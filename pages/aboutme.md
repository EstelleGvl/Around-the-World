I am a French woman who embarked on her travel journey in adulthood. In 2013, I got my first passport to move to Canada to pursue a master's degree in Medieval History. I spent 9 months in Quebec City, and this is when I truly fell in love with travelling. 

I was 21. 

Fast forward a decade, and I've since called two more countries home while exploring over 30 others. Throughout my travels, I've had the pleasure of travelling with friends and partners, but in 2018, I took my very first solo trip, and it was nothing short of a transformative experience. This solo expedition to [Georgia]() was a **game-changer**! 

I had never imagined that I could accomplish so much on my own, and it not only enriched my understanding of different cultures but also led me on a path of self-discovery. Venturing solo into remote regions, countries where language was a barrier, engaging in activities like diving, hiking, or horse-riding in the middle of nowhere boosted my self-confidence. I realized that I was capable of anything.

Today, as I am pursuing my PhD at Yale University, I continue to plan trips and I am eager to share what I have learnt with you. My goal is to inspire women to embrace solo travel and to show you that it is not just a fantastic experience but also an accessible and deeply fulfilling one. 

Not all my trips are solo-trips and I will also share with you how travelling, alone or not, is amazing. As a lesbian woman, I also aim to address questions that members of the LGBTQ+ community may have when it comes to traveling the world.

I hope this blog becomes a valuable resource. Please don't hesitate to [connect with me](https://www.instagram.com/estelle_gvl/)!

Here is the list of the countries I have been to. I will keep it updated as it grows.
