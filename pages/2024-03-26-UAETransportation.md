# General Recommendations

Choosing how to visit a country may seem daunting at times. In the UAE, public transportation exists but is not what I would recommend: it is not frequent nor well-deserved in most places. Dubai has a metro that is clean and fast, but has a limited number of lines. Because Dubai is such a large city, using the metro can take a LOT of time.  

Depending on your plans and the places you want to visit (i.e. moving between cities and Emirates or staying in Dubai or Abu Dhabi), I would recommend to either rent a car or use taxis.

# Public Transportation
## Abu Dhabi
There is a bus system in Abu Dhabi. However, in my 6 years in the country, I never used it. It can be crowded and it increases the travel-time a lot. If you are curious about the bus lines, check out [this website]().

## Dubai
Dubai has a system of buses and a metro which includes 3 lines. I used it a few times in 2023 during a course-trip with my class at Yale. Although it is clean and decently priced, it may still take a lot of time to reach your destination. The metro stations are far from each other and you may need to walk a lot or to take taxis to finally arrive where you want. 

You can check out [this website]() for information about the lines or the prices.

## Elsewhere
The rest of the country has a practically non-existant public transit. Do not try to get out of the large cities by public transit.

However, a bus links Abu Dhabi and Dubai, for 30 aed (one way). You can find all the information [here]().

# Taxis and Ubers
Like in [Qatar](https://estellegvl.github.io/Around-the-World/qatar), Taxis are the easiest way to travel in the UAE. They are fairly cheap (cheaper in Abu Dhabi than in Dubai).

They are everywhere and you can just wave in the streets for them to stop. Since the names of the streets are not really used by anyone, be ready to name the closest landmark (a hotel, a mall, etc.) to indicate where you want to go. You can also put your destinations on a gps and hand over your phone to the driver if needed.

They now accept all methods of payment (cash and card) so it's really easy. If you have a UAE phone number, you can also download the apps ([Abu Dhabi]() and [Dubai]()) to book taxis if needed (or see where they are).
