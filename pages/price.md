For the purpose of this website, I created a reference frame to sort countries I have visited in 5 levels, from the least expensive (1) to the most expensive (5).

The levels include prices of, based on my own experience:
- Accomodations
- Food and beverages
- Activities
- Transportation

I tend to travel as an average person, neither extremely luxuous in 5-star hotels and eating in the best restaurants nor extremely cheap staying in hostels and eating street-food all the time. This means that you can of course choose to do either of those things and spend a lot more or a lot less money, but hopefully this website will give you an idea of how expesnive, on average, travelling to each country can be.

I did not include the price of flights in these estimations as it can vary tremendeously based on where you are flying from. I have lived in four different countries, and traveling from Abu Dhabi to Kazakhstan will be a lot cheaper than from the US for example. 

Here is a rough estimate of each level:
