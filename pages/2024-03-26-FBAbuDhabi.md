## Pro tips
Many of these restaurants (the expensive ones) offer a business lunch that will allow to try the menu without paying the full price. Niri for example, has an offer at 100 aed for soup, starter, main and ice cream. You are full and the food is excellent!

## Pro tips
Many places now offer ladies and/or gents nights. Check out[this website]() to find out which places have such offers, when they are and what the offer is.

# Cafes
There are plenty of good cafes and bakeries in Abu Dhabi. Because they are not in hotels (and therefore do not serve alcohol), they are usually a lot cheaper than the places mentioned above. Here are a few I recommend. You can usually also get food there.
- Art Cafe
- Mono
- Casper & Gambinis

# Shisha
In the UAE, you can find shisha pretty much anywhere. Attention however, to the price and quality. Shishas offered in restaurants and bars in hotels are extremely expensive. My recommendation is to go to a cafe where the shisha will be good and much cheaper. My top places are XXX and Mono.
