| Cyprus | 8 days (15-22 October 2021)
| :--------------------:   | :----------------------:|
| From the [UAE](https://estellegvl.github.io/Around-the-World/uae)       | Solo-trip           |

Cyprus was never a top country on my list of places I wanted to go to. However, when I needed last-minute trip, relatively close to the UAE at the end of October 2021, my choice happened to be Cyprus. To this date, I have mixed feelings about this trip. Although I loved diving and haking there, Cyprus remains a VERY touristy destination

# Cyprus. An Overview
Cyprus is an island country located in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, situated at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is the third-largest island in the Mediterranean and has a rich history, diverse culture, and stunning natural beauty.

It is an island nation with a complex history and a unique political status. Its rich history dates back to the Neolithic period, and it has been inhabited by various civilizations over the centuries, including Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Venetians, Ottomans, and British who left their mark on this island.

It was conquered by the Ottoman empire in 1571, which resulted in three centuries of Turkish rule. In 1878, the British Empire took control of Cyprus in order to prevent Ottoman positions falling under control of Russia – and an agreement was reached which allowed the Ottoman Empire to retain ownership. In 1922, after the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, the island remained under British control, up until 1960, when Cyprus gained independence from British colonial rule and became a republic. However, persistent intercommunal tensions between the Greek Cypriot majority and the Turkish Cypriot minority led to a Turkish invasion in 1974, resulting in the island's division into two parts. The southern part, known as the Republic of Cyprus, is internationally recognized and a member of the European Union, while the northern part, the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, is recognized only by Turkey.

When people mention Cyprus, they usually talk about the southern part, the larger of the two parts. It covers approximately 63% of the island's territory and includes cities such as Nicosia (the capital), Limassol, Larnaca, and Paphos. The self-declared state covers the remaining 37% of the island's territory and is recognized only by Turkey and its major city is North Nicosia (Lefkoşa). The division between the two parts is marked by a United Nations-controlled buffer zone known as the "Green Line."


<br>

# How Safe Is It?
## General Observations

Cyprus is generally considered a safe destination for tourists and travelers. It has a relatively low crime rate compared to many other European countries and little risk to be mugged. However, as usual when traveling in most countries, be aware of your surroundings and ensure that your belongings are secure at all times.

Cyprus has a zero tolerance to drug possession and use, and being caught using or in possession will result in a heavy fine or prison term.

Crossing the Green Line is possible, but there are some important things to keep in mind:
- There are designated official crossing points along the Green Line where individuals can cross between the two parts of the island. These are controlled by both Cypriot authorities and UN personnel.
- You will  need a valid passport or identity card to cross the Green Line. Visa requirements may also apply depending on your nationality and the purpose of your visit.
- The issue of the division of Cyprus is politically sensitive, and it's essential to be respectful of local customs and sensitivities on both sides of the Green Line.
- Inside the buffer zone itself, access is typically restricted, and it is not a place for tourism. The buffer zone serves as a demilitarized area under the control of the United Nations.
- Be aware that there may be specific regulations and restrictions for crossing the Green Line. These can vary, so it's advisable to check with the relevant authorities before your visit.

Overall, since most countries do not recognise the northern part, their ability to provide consular assistance in this area may be limited. Be careful when traveling there.

## Traveling as a Woman and a LGBTQ member

I never felt unsafe traveling in Cyprus alone. People were usually nice and welcoming in the rural areas and nobody really paid any attention to me in the urban and touristy ones. I would say that Cyprus is a good location for any woman wanting to travel alone.

Regarding homosexuality, it has been legal in Cyprus since 2016 and civil partnerships can take place. There is a number of gay bar in the main cities (see below)and traveling with a partner is not a problem. However, away from the main cities LGBTQ+ people are not widely accepted.


<br>

# Main challenges
For me, the main challenge of this trip was the transportation. I was moving almost everyday, and wanted to go to some rural areas in the mountains. I value my independance and I rented a car. However, Cyprus, as a former British colony, drives on the left. As a French person who has only lived in countries driving on the right, this was a MAJOR challenge. However, after a day or two, I got the hang of it, and it slowly became easier. 

Other than that, I would say that there was no major issue, whether it was communication, safety, or health risk.

## Day 3 - Diving

{:.no_toc}
### Diving - Akamas Dive Sites with "Latchi Dive Center"
- St. George's Island: 

This is the top dive spot on the Akamas Peninsula and among Cyprus's finest. St. George's Island's west wall, the most popular part, starts at 10 meters and plunges to around 34 meters before sloping even deeper. There's an abundant marine life, including Lionfish, Squirrelfish, Groupers, Amberjack, Peacock worms, and Nudibranch molluscs. Experienced divers can explore north along rock ledges, possibly spotting Moray eels. To end the dive, head back to the island and the dive boat, and at around 8 meters, you'll discover a cave with remarkable stalactites. The east/south side of the island offers a shallow start with interesting rock formations. An array of fish species, from small Wrasse to Cornet/Trumpetfish, Squid, Cuttlefish, and Amberjacks, await.


- Amphitheatre Bay: 

Amphitheatre Bay dive site has a fascinating history, once serving as a Roman stone quarry and later used by the British Army as a firing range. Even today, if you look closely in the shallows, you may still discover remnants of old ammunition. 

This site is suitable for divers of all experience levels. This is relatively shallow dive, starting at 7m and going up to 15m to 21m, but a beautiful one. Each bay offers a unique underwater landscape with diverse marine life. You might spot Moray eels, Octopus, small Rays, along with Damselfish, Flounder, Sea Stars, Nudibranch Molluscs, Sea Snails, and Sea Cucumbers.
