## Where to Stay?

Armenia offers a wid veariety of places where you can stay. Overall, because of the affordable prices and the culture, I recommend booking a hotel. If you like to travel like me and rarely spend more than one or two nights in one place, booking on [AirBnB]() and other similar platforms are usually not worth it.

Depending on your budget, you can book a double room in a 4-star hotel for as low as XXX$. On the other hand, if you want to enjoy a 5-star experience at the [XXX](), the prices can go up to XXX$ a night.

We stayed at the [XXX]() and payed XXX for 1 night (XXX$). As the time of writing this blogpost, the same room can be booked for XXX$. As usual when I travel, I used the platform [Booking]() to book my hotel.

## How to Move Around?
There are several ways to move around in Armenia. We walked a lot XXX

Other options include:

1. Car Rental: Renting a car can be convenient if you want to explore the country at your own pace and see more than just Doha. The road network is well developed, most hotels have parking and valets, there are many parkings. There are several international car rental companies operating in the country. You can get a car at the airport or, if you prefer, your hotel in Doha can probably help you. However, traffic can be heavy in some areas, if you are not used to driving in the Gulf, it can be a bit tricky. This is not undoable but it's important to familiarize yourself with the local driving laws and customs.

3. Public Transportation: Qatar's public transportation system is still developing, but it is possible to get around using buses and the metro. The metro is clean, efficient, and affordable, and operates in the greater Doha area. Buses are also available and serve a wider area, but they can be crowded and less convenient.
