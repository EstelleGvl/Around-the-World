# How Safe Is It?
## General Observations
Given that Puerto Rico is a US territory, I was not sure what to expect: would the island be as unsafe as the rest of the mainland? However, until our last day, I felt quite safe. Locals were very welcoming and helpful and we had overall a great time. But on our last evening, our uber driver scared us by announcing that he had a gun in the car "for his and our safety". Needless to say, that did not reassure us at all. Only Americans think that guns bring safey!

Other than that, we did not have to worry about other types of criminality. In Rio Abajo, we even made the mistake of not closing the door properly but nothing happened. 

There was barely any language barrier: almost everyone speaks English and our memories of Spanish from highschool were enough to get around. The water is generally good but we decided to buy bottled water (big jars) to make sure we would be fine. We drank tap water in a few instances and had no issue at all.

# My trip
## Day 1 - Flying into San Juan and getting to Utuado

Our flight was slightly delayed and we arrived in San Juan in the late afternoon. After getting our luggage, we went searching for the shuttle service from our rental car company. We found it quickly and were on our way to the car rental place. The rental process went rather quickly (see below) and we were able to leave even before sundown. We decided to stop and get some groceries right next to Charlie's, at **XXX**, before getting on the road. The road to Utuado (about 1.5 hour) was quite good (despite a fair number a potholes). We stopped for dinner at **XXX** before going to our airbnb. The last portion of the road was quite 

![utuadoairbnb]()

### Top tips:
If you arrive with an earlier flight, stop at the Cueva del Indio (see below) on the way to Utuado. We did it at the end of the trip and it was absolutely worth the visit! We wish we had done it in the beginning when we were in the region: that would have saved us a lot of time.

<br>

## Day 2 - Mountains and Caves

{:.no_toc}
### Primera Cascada de la Planta
We had a slow morning and got on the road at 11am. We made the mistake to not call Camuy Caves and when we arrived shortly after 12pm, they told us that the next tour was at 2pm. With nearly 2 hours to kill, we had to think about another activity. We looked at the map and decided to drive to the Planta waterfall, nearly 30min from there. This was ABSOLUTELY worth it! This waterfall is easily accessible (3 min walk from the parking lot) and is GORGEOUS. There was barely anyone else and we were able to enjoy it until it was time to go back to Camuy.

{:.no_toc}
### Camuy caves
The visit is quite expensive (18$ per person) but worth it. This is a very interesting natural spot and the guides are very knowledgeable. 

![camuy]()

### Top tips:
Call Camuy before driving (or better: book a tour online) and go to the waterfall either before or after Camuy. If you are an early riser (and did not do it on day 1) you can also stop at the Cueva del Indio on the way.

<br>

## Day 3 - River Adventures and City Exploration

{:.no_toc}
### Tanama River Adventures



![tanama]()

{:.no_toc}
### Ponce




### Top tips:
Skip Ponce and drive direclty to Ceiba after the river adventure (and maybe stop to a waterfall on the road, such as **XXX**). Book an accomodation in Ceiba and take an early morning ferry to Vieques instead of the 1pm one we took.


![ponce]()

<br>

## Day 4 - Vieques

{:.no_toc}
### The Ferry
We took the 1pm ferry. Booking for ferries open 1 month before the date you want and they only sell 20% of the tickets/


{:.no_toc}
### Media Luna Beach
If you rent a car or a golf cart (we recommend it), drive to this beach which was recommended to us by Amanda at the Vieques Guesthouse. The road is quite bad and you'll need some driving skills here (especially with a golf cart, a car should be totally fine), but it is absolutely worth it! And this is a fun drive. Because the beach is difficult to reach, it is totally empty and absolutely stunning!

![medialuna]()

{:.no_toc}
### Esperanza Beach

![esperanza]()

{:.no_toc}
### Coconut Beach
This beach is right in front of the Vieques Guesthouse. In the parking lot, follow the small path in the forest and after a short walk (3min) you will arrive at this lovely, hidden beach. It is a beautiful place to watch the sunset and we had a great time there.

![coconut]()

{:.no_toc}
### Biobay tour

I loved the tour and the guides were very nice and knowledgeable. 
clear bottom canoes.

However, the logistics were not handled well, but this is partly my fault. I first emailed to get information. They answered, telling me there was availability the day I wanted at 7.45pm but I needed to call. I then called to book the tour. I gave all my information, including my email address, my phone number and my credit card details. They confirmed the tour for 2 was booked at 7.45. Fast forward to the day of the tour, I start to be anxious because I realise they never sent any confirmation by email or anything. We call and they confirm our booking (and actually send me an email this time), but at 6.30pm (but they don't say it has changed). I had planned the entire day for a tour at 7.45 so I needed to adjust things and we ended up having less time to explore the island as I wanted and expected.

![biobay]()


### Top tips:
- Ferry: book in advance and take an early morning ferry - these are less crowded. It will also give you more time on the island.
- Book a golf cart and explore the island and its many beaches.
- Spend at least an entire day on the island. Take a morning ferry, stay overnight (for the biobay tour) and take a ferry the day after.
- Book the Biobay tour with JAK and pay cash to save 5$ per person. Additionally, when you call them to book, if you don't receive a confirmation email, call them again or email them to avoid what happened to us.

![sevenseas]()


### Top tips:
- Check if the natural reserve reopened in advance.
- The seven seas beach has a large parking (5$ a day) and is beautiful. Explore the many hiking paths to other beaches.

<br>

## Day 6 - El Yunque

This day was supposed to be our diving/snorkeling day in Culbera. Unfortunalty, because of the weather conditions, the trip was cancelled and we had to change the plan. This is my biggest deception of this trip - not diving and not seeing Culbera -  so if you have a chance, I would still recommend trying to spend a day diving/snorkeling on this island. 

The company I booked with is **xxxx** and, although we did not spend the day as planned, I would book all over again with them. The booking process was very easy and they are the only ones I could find that allow snorkelers, experienced divers and discovery divers on the same boat for the same trip. This was amazing because my partner does not dive but I didn't want us to spend a day on two different boats doing different things in different places. They were also great handling communicationg about the weather and the problems (called, texted and emailed to make sure they reach me!) and proceeded with the refund instantly. 

If you book with them and are lucky enough to have good weather, please let me know in the comments how the tour was!

{:.no_toc}
### Trail 1
So, instead of diving and snorkeling, we spent the morning doing laundry before heading to el Yunque forest. I had planned to hike the El Yunque Peak Trail (8km) and the La Coca trail (6km) but, because
5 miles

![Trail]()

### Trail 2
1.2km

![Butkowski Waterfall]()

### Top tips:
Do not stop at the Visitors' center. They make you pay at the entrance but it is not worth it if you're like us and only want information about the trails. Instead, do this:
- If you arrive early in the morning (between 8 and 9), you will most likely be able to enter the national park (for a fee) and do the El Yunque Peak trail and/or La Coca trail. They are indicated as challenging, but we noticed that most hiking trails' difficulty is overestimated. If you exercise regularly at home and have hiking shoes, you'll be fine.
- If you arrive later and can't enter the park, do what we did as described above. The one we did is the other half of the Coca trail (but without the crowd and the fee to pay) and it was nice (albeit humid).

# My Tips and Recommendations
## How to Move Around?
As usual, I would recommend renting a car unless you want to spend your time only in San Juan and/or Vieques/Culebra. Day-trips for San Juan are doable for some close locations and activities (Cueva del Indion Camuy Caves, etc.) but for any early activities, it becomes tricky. I love the independance provided by a car and it allows for last minutes changes of plans. 

We HIGHLY recommend booking your car with [Charlie Car Rental](https://www.charliecars.com/). This is a locally owned company and they were amazing! This is truly the best rental car company I've ever rented with. They were so friendly, had a fast service and the car was great! The car was in a very good condition, and had android carplay and cruise control which made driving, having the gps and listening to music super easy.

What I really appreciated is the fact that they have great prices with no hidden fees: everything is mentioned on the website such as the price of the insurance you will need if you're not from the US, what documents you need if you have a US insurance (call your company and make sure you're covered in Puerto Rico and print all relevant documents), etc. They explain everything, unlike international companies which add fees once you are at the counter. We also took their toll offer, and it made our life SO MUCH easier! If you don't take it, you have to take the right line at every toll gate, pay in cash (I think) and sometimes, the cashier is closed and I am not sure how things work in that case. Honestly, avoid the hassle, and take the Pre-paid toll option (or the Toll option if you won't use the highway much).

The return process was also fast and easy. They gave me back my deposit (500) after a quick check of the car and we were done. I can't recommend them enough!
They also have a shuttle service from and to the airport and are open 24/7.

To summarize:
- Cheap and no hidden fees
- Shuttle to and from the airport
- Open 24/7
- Great cars and staff
- Take one of the toll options
- Check your insurance before arriving


<br>

## How Long Should You Stay?
We stayed a long week and we wished we had a few more days. We would have loved to stay at least another day in Vieques, we did not have time to visit Culebra, and there is an astronomical number of waterfalls, beaches, caves and hiking trails I would have loved to see. Unless you want to stay in San Juan or in a resort, a week is probably the minimum and I would recommend up to two weeks to enjoy the entirety of the island(s) and their many activities.

<br>

## When to Go?
January is the best season to travel to 
<br>

## Where to Stay?
We primarily used airbnb as hotels can be very expensive in Puerto Rico. We booked a guest house in Vieques because of the great reviews and fair price for the island. We highly recommend each - but one - of the places where we stayed, for several different reasons:
- Utuado:

- Ponce:

- Vieques: [The Vieques Guesthouse](https://www.theviequesguesthouse.com/)
Beautiful location with exceptionally helpful hosts (Amanda is a wealth of information - she helped us make the most of our short trip to the island!). The guesthouse is very clean and the rooms are super comfortable. 

Go up on the rooftop at night for a beautiful view of the stars. Walk through the path going out of the parking lot (~3 min) to [el cocal beach](https://maps.app.goo.gl/m3Nj6vcsUHikhFe18) to see the sunset. If you have a car or golf cart you can drive to la media luna beach which is gorgeous and empty ! We loved our stay there and will definitely book again !


- San Juan:

As for the one we do not particularly recommend, some of you might still find it interesting so we decided to post it here nonetheless:
- Rio Abajo;


<br>

## Where to Eat?
### In San Juan
- Abracadabra in Santurce

### In Vieques
- 

### In Utuado
- Utuado bakery: very cheap and yummy sandwiches to pack for your daily excursions.
- 

### In Ponce
- 

<br>

## What to Pack?
Everything!
We understimated how many clothes we would need and were lucky to be able to do some laundry in Rio Abajo, in the middle of our trip. Puerto Rico is a hot and humid island. This fact added to all the activities we did, we wore much more than one outfit a day (and you can't reuse anything because you sweat!). You will need hiking equipment (both for hiking trails and if you want to do some river adventures), swimming equipment (canoe, snorkeling, diving, beach time, etc.), shorts and tee-shirts and dresses for city days and evenings and maybe a pair of pants for evenings and/or flights. Take more socks and underwear than the number of days you are staying, you will need them! And this advice also applies to shoes: hiking shoes, flip-flops, water shoes, city shoes, etc. I am usually an efficient packer and traveler and I really did not expect to use that many things.
You are now warned!
