The content of this page, as for any country where I lived, will be a bit different. It will focus on regions, activities and tips to travel like a local (transportation, accomodations, food, etc.). FInd the links to these specific pages below.

I lived in Canada in 2013-2014, more precisely in Quebec city while I pursuing my master's degree in medieval history (exchange program). It was an amazing year and I hope to live in Canada again at some point of my life. In the meantime, because it is close(ish) to New Haven where I now live, I try to do regular trips to Montreal and other parts of the country.

This post will focus mostly on Quebec (and Ontario) as these are the only two provinces I have visited (or lived in) so far. I will keep everything updated as I discover more!
