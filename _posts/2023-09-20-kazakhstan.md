| Kazakhstan | 8 days (2-9 April 2022)
| :--------------------:   | :----------------------:|
| From the [UAE](https://estellegvl.github.io/Around-the-World/uae)       | Couple-trip           |


In April 2022, I decided to go to Kazakhstan. If you have read my [Kyrgyzstan](https://estellegvl.github.io/Around-the-World/asia/kyrgyzstan) post, you know that I was lucky to meet some Kazakhs who basically saved my life when I was hiking in Jeti Oguz in May 2021. I stayed in contact with them and I promised them that I would come and visit one day. That day came in April 2022. I knew my time in the UAE was limited and that I would not really get a chance to go to Kazakhstan after I moved to the US. This was the right time and I sent a text to my friends. In a few days, the trip was planned, the tickets booked, and here I was, flying once again to central Asia, but not alone this time.

# Kazakhstan. An Overview
Kazakhstan, once a member of the Soviet Union, occupies a strategic location at the crossroads of Central Asia and Eastern Europe. It stands as the largest landlocked country globally, sharing its borders with Russia to the north, China to the east, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan to the south, and being bordered by the Caspian Sea to the west. Kazakhstan's geographical diversity encompasses expansive steppes, arid deserts, towering mountain ranges, and a shoreline along the Caspian Sea.

The history of Kazakhstan is a mosaic of diverse cultures and influences that span millennia. It has been inhabited since the Paleolithic era, hosting nomadic tribes such as the Turkic Khazars and experiencing the expansion of the Achaemenid Persian Empire in its southern regions. In the 13th century, it fell under the rule of the Mongol Empire led by Genghis Khan. The 15th century witnessed the establishment of the Kazakh Khanate, which later formed the core of modern Kazakhstan. By the 18th century, it became a part of the Russian Empire and later, a constituent republic of the Soviet Union. The path to independence commenced in 1991 with the dissolution of the USSR, culminating in Kazakhstan's emergence as an independent nation.

Presently, Kazakhstan operates as a presidential republic characterized by a dominant-party system. Nursultan Nazarbayev served as the country's inaugural president for nearly three decades until he stepped down in 2019. Kassym-Jomart Tokayev succeeded him and continues to serve as president as of the time of writing this blog post. Kazakhstan's political landscape has been marked by efforts to balance relations with major powers like Russia and the West, while also holding memberships in international organizations such as the United Nations and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).

Economically and politically, Kazakhstan holds sway over Central Asia, contributing to 60 percent of the region's GDP, primarily driven by its oil and gas industry and abundant mineral resources. Additionally, it boasts the highest Human Development Index ranking among its regional peers.

# How Safe Is It?
## General Observations
Kazakhstan is generally considered a safe country for tourists. It has a relatively low crime rate compared to many other countries, and violent crimes against tourists are rare. 

However, some precautions should be taken, such as:
- Be cautious about food and water hygiene. Drink bottled water as much as you can.
- Language Barrier: while many people in major cities, especially in the capital, Nur-Sultan (formerly Astana), and Almaty, speak English or Russian, you may encounter language barriers in more remote areas. It can be helpful to learn some basic phrases in Kazakh or Russian if you can (or hire a guide - see below).
- Altitude: If you plan to visit mountainous regions like Almaty or Shymbulak, be aware of the potential for altitude sickness and acclimatize accordingly.
- Border Areas: Some border areas, particularly near Kazakhstan's borders with Russia, China, and some Central Asian countries, may have restricted access. Check the latest travel advisories and regulations if you plan to visit border regions.

## ## Traveling as a Woman and a LGBTQ person

In Kazakhstan, Islam is the predominant religion, with Sunni Islam being the most widely practiced, coexisting harmoniously with other faiths. Religious tolerance is a cornerstone of Kazakh society, with freedom of religion guaranteed by the constitution. Russian Orthodox Christianity, Protestantism, Judaism, and other religious groups are also represented in the country. Kazakhstan is a secular state, but religion plays a significant role in its cultural fabric, observed through various religious holidays and traditions. The nation promotes interfaith dialogue and values its diverse religious heritage, which has left an indelible mark on its art, music, and architecture. Visitors are encouraged to respect local customs and appreciate the rich tapestry of religious diversity that defines Kazakhstan.

The situation for LGBTQ+ individuals in Kazakhstan is complex. Homosexuality is legal, but there are no specific anti-discrimination laws protecting LGBTQ+ rights. Social attitudes can be conservative in some areas, leading to discrimination and prejudice, while urban centers generally exhibit more tolerance. LGBTQ+ individuals may choose to keep their sexual orientation or gender identity private due to potential challenges. Pride events have faced opposition, and support organizations often operate discreetly. LGBTQ+ travelers should exercise caution, respect local customs and laws, and stay informed about the evolving situation, as acceptance and attitudes may vary across regions in Kazakhstan.

# My Tips and Recommendations
## How to Move Around?
There's one thing I must say: it is not the easiest thing in the world to move around on your own in Kazhakstan. Almaty is relatively well by public transit but as soon as you want to go out of the city, things are trickier.

The language barrier can also make things harder. Kazakhstan is a country where the population speaks mainly Russian beside the national language, Kazakh, a Turkic language close to Nogai, Kyrgyz and Karakalpak. Unfortunately, none of us spole any of these languages and the local population did not speak English, French or any other language we spoke. Communication was somewhat hard. To add to this, there are many police roadblocks, access to the mountains or the natural sites can sometimes be blocked for no reason and there is absolutely no way of knowing this before you are stopped by the police.


<br>

## How Long Should You Stay?
Kazakhstan is a huge country, the world's ninth-largest country by land area and the world's largest landlocked country. However, it has only 19 million people and one of the lowest population densitites. You won't have the time to see all of the country. My advice would be to focus on a specific part of the country, like we did. The region of Almaty is usually one of the top choiches, along with Noursoultan (ex-Astana), the capital. From Almaty, you can travel around quite easily and visit many other places. I wouldn't recommend going for less than a week. If you have time, ten days to two weeks is probably what I would recommend to get a good overview of the country.
