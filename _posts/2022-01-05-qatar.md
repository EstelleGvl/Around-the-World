In June 2022, with more than 45°C (113°F), Doha has been my last trip from [Abu Dhabi](/abudhabi). After the [Bahraini](/bahrain) surprise, I wanted to visit the Qatari capital and its museums before leaving the [UAE]() for good to start a new life in the [United States](/usa). It has been a great discovery, full of amazingly sweet people, great food, culture and entertainment.

# Qatar. An Overview
Qatar is a small country located in the Middle East, on the northeastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula. With a long history of foreign rule, by the Ottomans, and then as a British protectorate since 1916, Qatar declared its independence on September 3, 1971. It is now part of the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council), an intergovernmental, political, and economic union established in May 1981, along with [Bahrain](/bahrain), Kuwait, [Oman](/oman), Saudi Arabia and the [United Arab Emirates](/uae).

Qatar is, officially, a semi-constitutional and hereditary monarchy, ruled by the House of Thani since the late 19th century. The current Emir, the eighth, is Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani who has been ruling since 2013. A muslim country with only one border with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, it counts 2.6 million inhabitants, among which only about 12% are Qataris (slightly more than 300 000 people). The rest of the population is made of expatriates from all over the world. It is also one of the wealthiest countries in the world with the fourth GDP (gross domestic product) per capita in 2020.

Qatar has recently been put under the light for hosting the 2022 FIFA World Cup, becoming the first Arab and Muslim-majority country to do so. The preparation of this event also highlighted a number of issues related to Human Rights as well as religious freedom and LGBTQ+ rights. Officially, as in the [United Arab Emirates](/uae), Qatar uses the Sharia law, making apostasy and homosexuality crimes punishable by the death penalty while blasphemy is punishable by up to 7 years in prison. However, in practice, the country enforces a mixture of Sharia law and Civil law and, and no capital sentence has been recorded so far for the crimes mentioned above.

# How Safe Is It?
## General Observations

After this rather scary introduction, you must wonder if it is safe for you to travel to Qatar. **The answer is yes!**

Qatar, like most other countries in the GCC, is extremely safe. It is actually **THE safest country** in the world, just before the [United Arab Emirates](/uae) according to [Numbeo](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/). Other rankings usually put the country in the top 20 of the safest countries in the world. 

You do not need to worry about being robbed, you can leave your waller on a table and go to the bathroom without fear of it being stolen, you can walk in the streets at night without fear of being mugged or attacked.

But is it safe for everyone?

## Traveling as a Woman and a Lesbian

As I mentioned earlier, Qatar is a muslim country enforcing the sharia law. Officially, being gay in Qatar is illegal and punishable. In practice,
